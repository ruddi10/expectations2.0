  title: "Branch Change",
  content:
    "<p>Finding people in IITs who are enrolled in a branch that was not their first choice is not a rarity. Also, owing to the limited knowledge that people have content the different branches and their curriculum, choosing the right branch for yourself is not as easy as it may seem. In order to compensate for this almost all the IITs provide an option of branch change for the students including IIT Roorkee. Contrary to most of the other IITs that offer an option of branch change at the end of the first year, at IIT Roorkee the process takes place at the end of the first semester itself.</p><p>Talking content the technical details related to branch change, there isn’t much actually. As stated in the <a href='https://www.iitr.ac.in/academics/uploads/File/2016/syllabus/Academic%20Syllabus%202016-17.pdf'>UG Ordinances and Regulations 2016 </a>, all the undergraduate students except for the students enrolled in the B.Arch course are eligible for a branch change. This also means that there are no restrictions placed on changing from a five year course to a four year course or vice versa. Earlier, the change of branch takes place against the number of vacant or unoccupied seats in the branch or two(2) whichever is higher, but recently the number has been increased to 10% of the total number of seats in the branch. The unoccupied/vacant seats are filled only on the basis of merit(read SGPA) in that particular category in which the seats are vacant, however the two extra seats are filled on the basis of combined merit and have no reservations. Also, in the cases where two people with the same SGPA have the same preference of branch, the JEE Advanced rank is used as a tiebreaker. There are a few other criterias that need to be fulfilled for a branch change such as not having backlogs and not having been penalized for indiscipline, but in most cases these will be implicitly fulfilled even if you have a near-decent shot at a branch change.</p><p>When we come to the rigour associated with getting a branch change, it actually depends on the branch that you are trying to change to. Based on general trends, the branches which are most sought after in the JEE counselling also become the most desired branches during branch change. For branches like CSE, the competition is very tough and one might miss it even after scoring a perfect 10 SGPA. As we move other branches, it becomes comparatively less difficult but is still arduous enough. The most efficient and probably the best way of scaling this task to workable limits is consistency. Attending the classes regularly and taking proper notes are recommended if not exhorted. The pursuit of getting a branch change will also involve some sacrifices on your part such as completing all the tutorials on your own (and watching your batchmates copy them, thanklessly) and missing out on some chapos, but in the end it will be all worth it. The added benefit is that even if you miss out on a branch change by some grade points, you will have a healthy CGPA at the end of your first semester, a thing that will prove to be really helpful in the long run.</p>",

    "<p><i><strong>Research is to see what everybody else has seen, and to think what nobody else has thought</strong></i><br>-Dr. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi</p><p>Being one among the most sought after institutes of the country, and hence, an agglomeration of some of the brightest minds, IIT Roorkee is an institute that is expected to have a firm-footed research culture and produce some unparalleled research output. These assumptions turn out to be true but only to limited extents. Owing to the heterogeneity of the student population in terms of their interests and future aspirations, the research culture at IIT-R lags behind a few other research centred colleges in India (read IISc, IISERs, etc) but is still dynamic enough to provide adequate opportunities to the enthusiastic. On a positive note, the state of undergraduate research at IIT Roorkee is consistently improving both due to the efforts of the administration and also the student community (essentially, people who are already pursuing a career in research).</p><p>Research activities at IITR are aptly supported by proper infrastructure and facilities. The Central Library at IIT Roorkee is a member of the National Digital Library Consortium through which students can gain access to over 15000 journals belonging to various domains of Science, Engineering and Technology. Apart from this, several standard books on varied topics are present for the reference of students at both the Central and the departmental libraries. Talking content infrastructure, the institute has several dedicated facilities like the Institute Computer Centre and the Institute Instrumentation Centre, apart from the departmental laboratories and research centres.In addition to this, the newly set-up Tinkering Lab provides free 3-D printing facilities to the students which could provide a huge boon for engineering-based research taking place at IITR. All this is supported by a 400 member strong faculty where some of the professors are the pioneers in their field at the global stage.</p><p>The step of initiation for any undergraduate at IITR, in the field of research, is generally taking up a project under a professor. There is no set procedure for doing this. Just being on the lookout for professors who have common fields of interests and discussing the prospects of a project with them is sufficient. The process is actually much easier than it sounds. After having started working on a project, the outcomes generally depend on the amount of hard work put in and some people even succeed in getting their research published in renowned journals and conferences.</p><p>A recent initiative by the administration is the Spark IITR programme, aimed at cultivating enthusiasm for research amongst UG students. Under the Spark programme, the institute offers funded, project-based summer internships to UG students of IITR and other institutes. Candidates can choose from a list of projects with their associated faculty after two semesters of undergraduate study, provided they fulfill the CG requirements. Applications for the program are to be submitted in the spring semester, before February 28th, and selected candidates would be allowed to start their summer training immediately after the completion of their end term exams. The project serves as a gateway for potential research enthusiasts to follow their passion through Master’s or PhD courses in the institute.</p><p>A lot of national and international programs also open their doors for the students of IITR for pursuing research in various top institutions around the world. Through these programs, students are offered funded research internship positions during the summer breaks. Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship(SURF) offered by CalTech, Charpak Scholarship offered by the Embassy of France, German Academic Exchange Service(DAAD) for German Colleges and Mitacs Globalink Research Internship offered for Canadian universities are some of the many programs utilised by students for getting an international research exposure. Other programs such as those by Indian Academy of Sciences(IAS), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research(TIFR) and various IITs and IISERs offer similar research opportunities in India. To apply for these programs, it is important to keep track of updates on their websites since the beginning of the Autumn semester. Students can also mail professors with coherent interests to ask for research internships.Though a little tough administratively, this is a good approach to work with researchers of aligning interests irrespective of their participation in any program or eligibility criteria.</p><p>Students also have an option for undergoing a semester exchange at colleges such as KTH Royal Institute of Technology Sweden, Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts Switzerland, York University Canada, HTWD Germany, ESTP France, University of Southampton, IIT Delhi and IIT Bombay.</p><p>Another provision that helps in encouraging students towards research is the ability to carry out projects outside IIT Roorkee. Students can avail this if they have an offer letter from the supervisor of the organisation.</p><p>In addition to this, Prime Minister’s Research Fellows is another opportunity that is offered to the students. This is open to final year students with a CGPA>8.0. If they are selected to pursue a PhD in the PMRF granting institutes of the country, they are granted a fellowship(upwards of INR 70000 per year) and a research grant of INR 200,000 per annum.</p><p>What sets IITR apart from other Institutes is the ability to pursue your Bachelor Thesis in a foreign university. Bachelor Thesis Project or BTP is the final year project, every undergraduate must undertake for completion of their graduation. IITR gives a student the flexibility to choose a foreign university to conduct his/her bachelor thesis, given he qualifies the criteria. Thus, a student can visit a university for a duration of 4th year, 1st semester and complete his/her BTP. This is made possible by taking courses early on such that you end up clearing a complete semester for your foreign visit. With a professor backing you up, semester courses cleared and approval from the title of Department, you can pursue research in a foreign university which is a feat in its own.</p><p>Altogether, even though the research at IIT-R lacks behind on some pointers, the university succeeds in providing ample opportunities to people who have the will and grit to pursue core research as a career.</p>",

In order to equip the students graduating from the college with more relevant skill-sets and knowledge base, the provision of pursuing a Minors in some other department or an Honors in your department of study has been running quite successfully at IITR.</p><h2 classtitle='normal-title'>Minor Specialization</h2><p>Students who are willing to excel in some specialization other than his/her own department, have the option for doing a Minor specialization in that department. Earlier, one needed to have a CGPA>7.5 to opt for a minor. Recent changes have scrapped this rule, however, a limit on the number of students in a course might be imposed. It consists of 4-8 additional courses equivalent to 18-30 credits that need to be taken up in the pre-final and the final year of college. Also, it is not necessary for the specialization to belong to the same discipline of study and it may be taken from any one of engineering, management, science and humanities. The most recent addition to this basket was a minor in Economics. Before the beginning of every semester, courses being offered for a particular minor specialization are floated and students have to pick up a few from that basket. These courses are called Minor Specialization Courses and have a fixed number of seats. For the people who successfully fulfill the required credits have the title of the minor specialization aptly mentioned on their degree they receive upon graduation.</p><h2 classtitle='normal-title'>Departmental Honours</h2><p>The basic structure of Departmental Honours is similar to Minor Specialization. Students with interests in their own department and having a CGPA greater than 7.5 can take 4-5 extra courses from their department and pass out with an Honours degree.

Similar to Minors, a student passing out with an Honours will have it mentioned in his degree.</p><h2 classtitle='normal-title'>Switching to an Integrated Dual Degree Program(IDD) from BTech Program</h2><p>Students at the end of their 3rd year are offered an option to switch to an integrated dual degree program (BTech + MTech).

IIT Roorkee helps and supports any request received from these institutions which are directly dealing with common people to solve any problem/issue that comes up in the course of their work. This started with the distribution of alcohol-based sanitizers to the common public with the installation of a dispensing unit for easy access by common people for a refill. Subsequently face shields were designed, fabricated, and distributed to all of these agencies for further distribution as per requirements. A sanitized chamber for sample collection has been fabricated and installed at the Civil Hospital Roorkee for protecting health workers while collecting samples. The work on the development of a low-cost ventilator is in an advanced stage of testing and several manufacturing units have been informed to begin mass-scale production.</p><p>In the long term, IIT Roorkee plans to collaborate with leading institutes in the search for a vaccine for the novel Coronavirus.

The calmness of the place is really soothing, and the low pollution here is a bonus. Roorkee is definitely a good choice, and people from cities will find it as a pleasant change.",

    title: "How does grading happen?",
    content:
      "There is a concept of CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) and SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) calculated with the help of Course Credits and Grades for each course. Most courses (i.e. courses with a little more than a handful of students enrolled) have a Relative Grading System. In this system, you are evaluated against your peers to decide which grade you get. This does not mean that you'll have to fight it out with your classmates all the time; it means that even getting a 60% might be good enough to get a very good grade in a difficult course. There is one mid-sem exam, one end-sem exam, and class-work-sessional marks assigned for each course (the split up varies, but is told at the start of the course itself) and these add up to your final score. Using a statistical formula based on the mean and standard deviation of the scores of all the students in a course, a grade is assigned on a scale of 10. These grades then are averaged over a semester, weighted by the number of course credits, to get the SGPA. Average all the courses over all the semesters that have occurred until a certain time, and you get your CGPA at that point of time. Mathematically speaking, it is the weighted average of SGPA of each semester with the total credits of that semester. The number of credits for a course is basically a small number (like 3 or 4) which roughly denote how many hours you will be spending on lectures, tutorials, and practicals with a course. It is generally an indicator of how important a course probably is.",

    title: "What is a good grade?",
    content:
      "Grades have always been a point of worry for students. It is essential to know that a grade does not define who you are. Keeping this fact in mind, it is generally a good idea to keep your grade above 7.5 as it ensures that you clear the cut offs for various CGPA dependent activities such as being a part of the college fest team or placement cell or competing in the student elections. A 7.5 or above CGPA also ensures good placement opportunities as it is generally the cut off for many Tier 1 companies. While a higher grade is somewhat of an advantage, it isn't worth it if that is what you only do in your years in college. A lot of the learning happens outside class, through interacting with others, taking part in groups and basically enjoying your time here. Sometimes, if you've done something outstanding in a non-course activity, companies might even ignore a difference (like between an X.6 and an X.4). Nonetheless, it is you who decide which grade is good for you, depending on your aspirations and future plans. If you intend to go for higher studies abroad and are looking for a scholarship, chances are, you need a CGPA above 8.5.",

    content:
      "It is a general belief that a branch change is a big task and a very difficult thing to achieve. However with a little hard work and focus it is possible. The modus operandi for changing your branch is to get a good GPA. For this, firstly attend classes regularly. Though this might seem tedious and boring, it has its benefits. It helps prevent a last minute rush when exams are near. Secondly making proper notes is also important – apart from making you popular for your famous notes, it also helps summarize the subject easily, in your own words. Last but not least, sacrifices - yes, sorry to disappoint you but to change the branch sometimes you may have to miss some chapos (lingo at IITR for parties) or various events which happen round the semester in campus. You might even need to ditch the Pronites during Thomso. However, branch change at IITR happens at the end of the first semester itself, so it is only a semester for which you might have to miss these things. While religiously sacrificing everything materialistic is a good idea, do not forego recruitments to different groups, because it is these which will make your 4-5 years in college worth remembering. Instead, make your few sacrifices count using proper time management. The cutoffs for each branch vary each year and thus it is not possible to predict the branch for a particular grade point. However, the better the CGPA, the higher your chances. Even if you don’t get it, trying for branch change has its advantages because you end up with a good solid CGPA.",

Kholu literally means opener, in IIT-R this term refers to the person who opens the institute and/or branch by fetching the best rank in JEE-Advance in the institute or the corresponding branch. <br>These are some of the words you would be welcomed with, in the campus. Besides these, there is ‘Ghissu’, which is used to describe a person who is the epitome of a nerd and is too cautious about his grades. The term is generally used incorrectly for the purpose of ego satisfaction by many and in which case, it can be conveniently ignored. One of the coolest among all these words is ‘machau’ or ‘macha diya’. The term is used for somebody who achieves something of great importance. Definitely, this is one of the words you would want to be tagged with.<br>These are some of the very common ones used in the campus.
